# The Story

I have been playing competitive badminton locally for 5 years. Our circles played fixtures at each other's clubs. While my circle, I was and have always been a badminton enthusiast, ready to do anything to propel the sport forward. 

I wanted to do something to contribute to the local community. This was what I started out with. It was left due to me finding paid work in the world of JavaScript/React/SvelteKit, so naturally, Ruby on Rails became deprioritized as it was more important to secure a grip in the JS frameworks and master them.

Feel free to take a look at the Facebook page for my sports club, [Askari 5 Badminton Club](https://www.facebook.com/AskariSmashers/), I used to play here from 2019 to 2025, and I must say, it's been a terrific journey with all of my teammates.
